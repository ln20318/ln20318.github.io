	<hr>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p style="text-indent:40px">There are many whales in America. There are big whales. There are small whales.
	Some whales like to swim in the ocean. Some like to swim in the sea. Some whales
	don't like swimming at all, but rather swing in the trees. Some whales eat cod and
	some whales eat oranges. Some whales have baby whales and some live in the city. 
	Whales are a diverse bunch, but we are going to do our best to tackle all the kinds
	of whales in this <big>informative</big> webpage.</p>

	<h2>Jumpy Whales

			style="width:300;height:300px;margin-left:30%" alt="A jumpy whale">
	
	</h2>
	
	<p>Above you can see a picture of a Jumpy Whale. This is a particular classification
	of whales that enjoy to jump. As you can see, this one above is jumping out of the water. It is unknown by
	scientists why these whales jump. However, I did some investigative reporting asked my buddy Dave, a jumpy whale,
	why he enjoys jumping. "Jump life bro," is what he responded.</p>

	<h2>Hippopotamus Whales</h2>
	
	<p>Similarities between hippopotami and whales: </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Large</li>
		<li>Swim (H<sub>2</sub>O)</li>
		<li>Mean looking</li>
		<li>Slimy</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>After intense research, I discovered that hippopotami are indeed a type of whale.
	As you can see above, the evidence is overwhelming. These types of whale are particularly
	nefarious, as they live in the swamp and like to swim eerily in the water.</p>

	<h2>Moose

	</h2>
	
	<p>The moose is the most landfaring whale of North America. With four legs, it is the most precarious whale
	in the whale kingdom. Onlookers enjoy watching its horns spike through the surrounding land objects, such as
	trees and plants. The <del>whale</del> <del>moose</del> <del>whale</del> moose is my personal favorite whale.</p>
